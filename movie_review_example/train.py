  Train pytorch model on a single pass through the data loader.

  It will use the global variable `model` which is the transformer model 
  loaded on `_device` that we want to train on.

  This function is built with reusability in mind: it can be used as is as long
    as the `dataloader` outputs a batch in dictionary format that can be passed 
    straight into the model - `model(**batch)`.

  Arguments:

      dataloader (:obj:`torch.utils.data.dataloader.DataLoader`):
          Parsed data into batches of tensors.

      optimizer_ (:obj:`transformers.optimization.AdamW`):
